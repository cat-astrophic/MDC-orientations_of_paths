## Description

This script takes a user chosen orientation of a path and outputs a minimum dominator coloring of that oriented path via the algorithm presented in *A Linear Algorithm for Minimum Dominator Colorings of Orientations of Paths*.

Built in options for path orientations include a directed path, a path with no (internal) vertices of out-degree one, a random orientation, and a custom orientation.

## Future Improvements

Eventually the interface should be improved...drastically...
